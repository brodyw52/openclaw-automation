# Lead Enricher

Turn LinkedIn leads into actionable contacts with full profile data and verified emails.

## What It Does

**Stage 1: Profile Enrichment (RapidAPI)**
- Fetches full LinkedIn profile data
- Gets company, title, industry, experience
- May find email directly from LinkedIn profile

**Stage 2: Email Enrichment (Hunter + Apollo)**
- Finds work email using Hunter.io
- Falls back to Apollo if Hunter misses
- Returns verified emails with confidence scores

## Invocation

```bash
# Full two-stage enrichment (recommended)
./scripts/profile-enrich.sh leads.json | ./scripts/enrich.sh > enriched.json

# Profile enrichment only (get profile data, skip email hunt)
./scripts/profile-enrich.sh leads.json > profiles.json

# Email enrichment only (skip profile, just find emails)
./scripts/enrich.sh leads.json > enriched.json
```

## Setup

# RapidAPI (for profile enrichment)

export HUNTER_API_KEY="28d6797942a805786911f093b13f5ff581db62a1"

# Apollo (optional fallback)

## Enrichment Strategy

```
Stage 1: Profile Enrichment (RapidAPI)
├── Fetch full LinkedIn profile
├── Extract: name, title, company, industry, experience, skills
├── Check for LinkedIn email → if found, mark for skip in Stage 2
└── Cost: 1 credit per profile

Stage 2: Email Finding (Hunter + Apollo)
├── Skip leads with linkedin_email found
├── Hunter Email Finder (primary)
│   ├── If score >= 70 and verified: ✅ Done
│   └── If not found or low score: Try Apollo
├── Apollo Fallback
│   └── Search by name + company
└── Cost: 1 Hunter search per lead
```
